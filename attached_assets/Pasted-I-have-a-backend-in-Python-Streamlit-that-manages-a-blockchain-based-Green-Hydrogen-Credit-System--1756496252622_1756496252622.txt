I have a backend in Python (Streamlit) that manages a blockchain-based Green Hydrogen Credit System (with user roles: producer, buyer, auditor).  
Now, I want you to create a **frontend in React.js (with TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + lucide-react)** that connects to my backend using REST APIs.  

The frontend should include:  

### 🔐 Authentication
- Login page with role-based access: **Producer, Buyer, Auditor**.  
- Store login state in localStorage/session.  

### 📊 Dashboards
- **Producer Dashboard**:  
  - Show balance of hydrogen credits.  
  - Button to issue new credits.  
  - Transaction history table.  
  - Profile info (digital identity).  

- **Buyer Dashboard**:  
  - Show current balance of credits.  
  - Option to purchase credits from producers.  
  - Transaction history table.  
  - Compliance certificates section.  

- **Auditor Dashboard**:  
  - View all issued/retired credits.  
  - Verify transactions and prevent double counting.  
  - Exportable reports (CSV/PDF).  

### 📈 Features
- Navigation bar with role-based menus.  
- Responsive layout with TailwindCSS.  
- Reusable components for tables, cards, forms.  
- API integration (using Axios) with backend endpoints:  
  - `/login` → login with username, password, role.  
  - `/balance` → fetch user’s hydrogen credit balance.  
  - `/transactions` → fetch transaction history.  
  - `/issue` → issue credits (producer).  
  - `/purchase` → buy credits (buyer).  
  - `/audit` → fetch all records (auditor).  

### 📱 Tech Stack
- React + Vite  
- TailwindCSS  
- shadcn/ui for modern UI components  
- Axios for API calls  
- React Router for role-based routing  

### ✅ Deliverables
- Fully working React frontend with role-based login.  
- Different dashboards for Producer, Buyer, Auditor.  
- Integrated transaction history & balance pages.  
- Ready to deploy on Replit.  

Please generate the **entire React project code** (with proper folder structure) so I can paste it into Replit and run it directly.
